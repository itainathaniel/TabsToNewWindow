TabsToNewWindow
===============
A Safari extension which opens many tabs in a new window

Sometimes I find myself with 15+ tabs open on my Safari, maybe after opening some links from a mailing list email I just got. Most of the tabs are relating only that email, so I want them to be in a seperate Safari window, but i'm too lazy to drag each of them - so I've made this extension.

You can grab the latest build of the extension here: [TabsToNewWindow.safariextz][safariextz] or downoad the code and use the Safari's Extension Builder.
